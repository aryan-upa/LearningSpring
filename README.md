# LearningSpring
This repository was created while I was learning the Spring Framework in Java.

## Spring Framework
The Spring Framework is an application framework and inversion of control container for the Java platform. 
There are several features of Spring framework which makes it really easy for developers to create and deploy fully functioning and secure applications. 
It helps us in focusing the main buisness logic rather than dwelling with creation of objects and calling functions. 

There are several libraries in the Spring Framework which are estabilished for specific purposes and  they make all sort of tedious tasks such as:
  - CRUD Operations in DB , 
  - Connecting and deploying Application to Servers etc. 

very easy.

## IOC & DI
The Spring follows *Inversion of Control* **(IOC)** design principle, independent of language. It does not actually create the object
rather it describes the way in which the object is created.

Spring follows the *Dependency Injection* **(DI)** design pattern through which the **Inversion of Control** is achieved. With Dependency Injection the 
responsibility of creating objects was shifted from Application to the Spring IOC Container, these is the main reason why spring is so celebrated framework
among the Java Developers.

## Projects Maintained by Spring :
